Policy Conflict Resolution.

When multiple policies apply to the same agent action, the conflict
resolution strategy determines which decision wins.

Strategies
----------
- **DENY_OVERRIDES** (safest): If ANY matching rule denies, the action
  is denied regardless of what other rules say. Standard in XACML and
  most enterprise policy systems.
- **ALLOW_OVERRIDES**: If ANY matching rule allows, the action is
  allowed. Useful for exception-based governance where you want
  explicit allow-rules to punch through default-deny policies.
- **PRIORITY_FIRST_MATCH** (current default): Rules are sorted by
  priority (highest first), and the first matching rule wins. This
  preserves backward compatibility with the existing PolicyEngine.
- **MOST_SPECIFIC_WINS**: Agent-scoped rules override tenant-scoped,
  which override global-scoped. Within the same scope, priority breaks
  ties. Models the intuition that "closer policies override distant ones."

Scopes
------
Each ``Policy`` can declare a ``scope`` that indicates its breadth:

- ``global``: Organization-wide default policies
- ``tenant``: Applied to a specific tenant or team
- ``agent``: Applied to a specific agent instance

When ``MOST_SPECIFIC_WINS`` is active, scope determines precedence.
When other strategies are active, scope is informational metadata.
