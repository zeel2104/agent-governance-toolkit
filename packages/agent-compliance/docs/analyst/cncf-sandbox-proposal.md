# CNCF Sandbox Proposal: Agent OS

## Name

**Agent OS** — A governance kernel for AI agents in cloud-native environments.

## Description

Agent OS is an open-source governance kernel that provides policy enforcement, prompt injection detection, capability-based security, and audit logging for AI agents running in production. It is the core component of the Agent Governance stack, which adds zero-trust communication (AgentMesh), runtime isolation (Agent Hypervisor), and reliability engineering (Agent SRE). Agent OS is designed to be embedded in cloud-native applications or deployed as a standalone API server, with native OpenTelemetry integration and Kubernetes-friendly deployment patterns.

## Statement on Alignment with CNCF Mission

Agent OS aligns with the CNCF mission of making cloud-native computing ubiquitous by providing the **governance layer for AI agents in cloud-native environments**.

Just as the CNCF ecosystem provides governance for containers and infrastructure:
- **OPA/Gatekeeper** governs Kubernetes admission policies
- **Falco** provides runtime security for containers
- **Trivy** scans container images for vulnerabilities

No CNCF project addresses the governance needs of AI agents — a rapidly growing category of cloud-native workloads. Agent OS fills this gap:
- **OPA governs what containers can do; Agent OS governs what AI agents can do**
- **Falco detects anomalous container behavior; Agent OS detects anomalous agent behavior**
- **Trivy scans containers for vulnerabilities; Agent OS detects prompt injection attacks**

AI agents are the next wave of cloud-native workloads, and they need purpose-built governance tooling that integrates with the CNCF ecosystem (OpenTelemetry, Kubernetes, Helm).

## Sponsor from TOC

TBD — Seeking a TOC sponsor. The project aligns with the Runtime and Observability TAGs.

## Unique Value

### What does Agent OS add to the CNCF landscape?

1. **First governance layer for AI agents in the CNCF ecosystem.** No existing CNCF project addresses AI agent safety, trust, or reliability. OPA, Falco, and Trivy are excellent for containers and infrastructure but do not understand agent-specific concerns like prompt injection, tool misuse, or autonomous decision-making.

2. **Native OpenTelemetry integration.** Agent OS exports governance telemetry (policy decisions, injection detection events, audit records) as OpenTelemetry traces and metrics, integrating seamlessly with the CNCF observability ecosystem.

3. **SRE discipline for AI agents.** Agent SRE brings SLOs, error budgets, and chaos engineering to AI agents — concepts proven in cloud-native operations but not yet applied to agentic AI workloads.

4. **Cloud-native deployment model.** Agent OS is stateless, horizontally scalable, and designed for Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts, HPA, and network policies.

```

**Design principles:**
- **Stateless kernel:** No session state in the governance API; scale horizontally without coordination
- **Policy-as-code:** Governance policies defined in YAML, version-controlled alongside application code
- **Framework-agnostic:** Works with any AI agent framework via REST API or Python SDK
- **Defense-in-depth:** Multiple detection strategies (heuristic, ML, canary) for prompt injection

## Similar Projects and Differentiation

| Project | Scope | Difference from Agent OS |
|---------|-------|--------------------------|
| **OPA/Gatekeeper** | Infrastructure admission policies | OPA governs Kubernetes resources; Agent OS governs AI agent behavior (prompt injection, tool permissions, output filtering) |
| **Falco** | Container runtime security | Falco detects syscall anomalies in containers; Agent OS detects behavioral anomalies in AI agents (prompt injection, privilege escalation, data leakage) |
| **Trivy** | Container/artifact vulnerability scanning | Trivy scans static artifacts; Agent OS provides runtime governance for dynamic AI agent behavior |
| **SPIFFE/SPIRE** | Workload identity | SPIFFE provides infrastructure identity; AgentMesh provides agent-level identity with trust scoring for multi-agent systems |
| **LLM Guard** | LLM input/output scanning | LLM Guard is a scanning library; Agent OS is a complete governance kernel with policy enforcement, capability control, and audit logging |

**Key differentiator:** Agent OS is the only project that provides a **complete governance stack** (policy + trust + runtime + SRE) for AI agents, designed for cloud-native deployment with native CNCF ecosystem integration.
