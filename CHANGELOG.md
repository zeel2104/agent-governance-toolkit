## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### 🚀 Highlights

**15 issues closed, 339+ tests added, 12 architectural features shipped** — in 72 hours from first analysis to merged code. This release transforms the toolkit from a well-structured v1.0 into an enterprise-hardened governance layer with real adversarial durability.

### Added — Security & Adversarial Durability

- **Policy conflict resolution engine** — 4 declared strategies (`DENY_OVERRIDES`, `ALLOW_OVERRIDES`, `PRIORITY_FIRST_MATCH`, `MOST_SPECIFIC_WINS`) with 3-tier policy scope model (global → tenant → agent) and auditable resolution trace. Answers the question every security architect will ask: "if two policies conflict, which wins?" (#91)
- **Session policy pinning** — `create_context()` now deep-copies policy so running sessions get immutable snapshots. Mid-flight policy mutations no longer leak into active sessions. (#92)
- **Tool alias registry** — Canonical capability mapping for 7 tool families (30+ aliases) prevents policy bypass via tool renaming. `bing_search` can no longer dodge a `web_search` block. (#94)
- **Human-in-the-loop escalation** — `EscalationPolicy` with `ESCALATE` tier, `InMemoryApprovalQueue`, and `WebhookApprovalBackend`. Adds the suspend-and-route-to-human path required by regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal). (#81)

### Added — Reliability & Operations

- **Inter-package version compatibility matrix** — `doctor()` function with runtime compatibility checking across all 5 packages. Detects silent version skew before it causes trust handshake failures. (#83)
- **Credential lifecycle management** — Wired `RevocationList` into `CardRegistry.is_verified()` so revoked credentials are actually rejected. Key rotation now has a kill path. (#82)
- **File-backed trust persistence** — `FileTrustStore` with JSON persistence, atomic writes, and thread safety. Trust scores survive agent restarts — misbehaving agents can no longer reset reputation by crashing. (#86)
- **Policy schema versioning** — `apiVersion` field with validation, migration tooling, and deprecation warnings. Schema evolution in v1.2+ won't silently break existing policy files. (#87)

### Added — Supply Chain & Certification (PR #99)

- **Bootstrap integrity verification** — `IntegrityVerifier` hashes 15 governance module source files and 4 critical function bytecodes (SHA-256) against a published `integrity.json` manifest. Detects supply chain tampering before any policy evaluation occurs. (#95)
- **Governance certification CLI** — `agent-compliance verify` checks all 10 OWASP ASI 2026 controls, generates signed attestations, and outputs shields.io badges for README embedding. `agent-compliance integrity --generate` creates baseline manifests for release signing.

### Added — Governance Enhancements (PR #90)

- **SIGKILL-analog process isolation** — Real `os.kill(SIGKILL)` for Linux, `TerminateProcess` for Windows, with PID tracking and cgroup integration. Not a simulated kill — actual process-level termination. (#77)
- **OpenTelemetry observability** — `GovernanceTracer` with distributed traces, span events for policy checks, custom metrics (policy evaluations, violations, latency histograms), and OTLP exporter integration. (#76)
- **Async concurrency safety** — `asyncio.Lock` guards on shared state, `ConcurrencyStats` tracking, deadlock detection with configurable timeouts. Concurrent agent evaluations no longer corrupt trust scores. (#75)
- **Policy-as-code CI pipeline** — `PolicyCI` class with YAML linting, schema validation, conflict detection, and dry-run simulation. Integrates with GitHub Actions for PR-time policy validation. (#74)
- **Deep framework integrations** — `LangChainGovernanceCallback`, `CrewAIGovernanceMiddleware`, `AutoGenGovernanceHook` with framework-specific lifecycle hooks, not just wrapper-level interception. (#73)
- **External audit trail integrity** — `SignedAuditEntry` with Ed25519 signatures, `HashChainVerifier` for tamper detection, `FileAuditSink` for append-only external storage. Cryptographic proof that audit logs haven't been modified. (#72)
- **Behavioral anomaly detection** — Statistical anomaly detection for agent behavior patterns (tool call frequency, response time, error rate) with configurable sensitivity. Catches rogue agents before they violate explicit rules. (#71)

### Added — Infrastructure

- **Copilot auto-review workflow** — Automated PR review on every pull request. (#70)
- **7 production module ports** — Episodic Memory Kernel, CMVK, Self-Correcting Agent Kernel, Context-as-a-Service, Agent Control Plane, Trust Engine, Mute Agent infrastructure — ported from internal production with full test coverage. (#63–#69)

### Fixed

- **44 code scanning alerts resolved** — CodeQL SAST findings across the entire repository including CWE-209 (error information exposure), CWE-116 (improper encoding), and CWE-20 (improper input validation). (#79)

### Security

- All cryptographic operations use real Ed25519 primitives (not placeholder/XOR).
- Prompt injection defense verified: `prompt_injection.py` + LlamaFirewall + `OutputValidationMiddleware`.
- SLO alerting verified: `AlertManager` with Slack, PagerDuty, Teams, and OpsGenie channels.

### Test Coverage

- **339+ new tests** across all features with full assertion coverage.
- All 5 packages pass CI independently.

### Install

```bash
pip install ai-agent-compliance[full]
